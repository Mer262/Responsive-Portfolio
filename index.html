            <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Meredith Moore">
            <p>I never quite expected to end up in a career in information technology. I grew up playing in the woods and riding horses. I was certain that I wanted to do some sort of work with the natural world when I grew up. I stayed on that path and earned a bachelor of science in biology.
            </p>
            <p> Upon graduation, I worked in the environmental field and truly enjoyed it. I investigated pollution problems affecting local watersheds, and collected data during the course of these investigations. All of these datasets had a geographic componment, which led me to learn how to use GIS software.</p>
            <p> I was acutely aware that my education did not match the work I was performing, so I decided to pursue a masters in GIS from Penn State. In 2013, I made the transition into the IT field. I no longer manage environmental data collection, yet instead I manage the applications and systems used to collect environmental data. As we increasingly rely on web-based GIS systems, I believe that learning more about web development is the natural next step.</p>
